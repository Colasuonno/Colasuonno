# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Colasuonno (Giovanni)!

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate developer currently studying Computer Science at **Sapienza UniversitÃ  di Roma**. Over the years, I've explored various technologies and programming languages, moving from Minecraft plugin development to working on **Odoo addons**. 

## ðŸ”§ What I work on:
- **Odoo Addons**: I create custom modules for the Odoo ERP system, helping businesses streamline their operations.
- **Minecraft Plugins**: In the past, I developed plugins to enhance Minecraft gameplay, adding custom features for both players and server admins.
